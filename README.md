# Transmissio-technology-LiFi

In this project, a simple intruder detection and alerting system using Li-Fi technology is discussed. The motive was to show
the benefits of using light for data transmission from indoor IoT devices to their IoT gateway. The system can not only transfer
real-time data continuously, but also incorporate an intruder detection scheme which is possible due to the intrinsic security nature
of light. This project also compares the transmission distance achievable using different light sources such as LED and Laser
